Known bugs:
- If branch/tag has a / in it, it won't work
   - if I have branches 'main', 'main/ghget', need to distinguish b/w:
     - https://github.com/marwanhawari/ghget/tree/main/ghget (the ghget folder in the main branch)
     - https://github.com/marwanhawari/ghget/tree/main/ghget (the root folder of the main/ghget branch)
